# Nekofee

Nekofee is my first Android project for practicing my Android skills. 

Nekofee allows user to find nearby coffee shops within a paricular radius provided by him/her. In addition, it provides following features:
+ View café detail: Name, address, rating, phone number, website, photos, working days, reviews,...
+ Support user contacting café through: phone number or website,..
+ Display route, distance, duration between user's location and café's on two transit modes: Driving and Walking
